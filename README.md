# octicode-assignment

Create a Wrdle gaem to get users from a Database and display them. Using Nesjs for the backend and reactjs for the frontend and tailwindcss for styling.

# How to run?

> [!NOTE]  
> You can find the `.env` file in the repository. I know it's not ideal to have it here, but it's just for testing purposes.

1. Go to the root directory, then open your terminal and run: `docker compose up -d`
2. Now you can see the app in your localhost: `localhost:3000`

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> I assume that you have docker in your machine, and it's running.

> [!WARNING]
> If you decide to use the second choice please run the backend first then frontend.
