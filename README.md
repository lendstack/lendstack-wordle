## Requirements:
Your task is to create a web-based Wordle game using React that adheres to the following specifications:

### User Interface (UI):

Design a clean and intuitive UI for the game that includes:

- Input field for guessing words.
- Submit button to submit the guess.
- Display area for previous guesses.
= Indication of correct letters in correct positions (right letter, right position).
- Indication of correct letters in the wrong position.
- Display remaining attempts.
- End game state UI (upon winning or losing).

### State Management:

Implement a robust state management system to handle:

- Target word selection (randomly generate a word at the start of the game).
- Storing user guesses and their results.
- Tracking remaining attempts.

### User Interaction:

- Capture user input for word guesses.
- Validate input (alphabetic characters, word length, etc.).
- Handle the submission of guesses and update the game state accordingly.


### Game Logic:

- Compare the user's guessed word against the target word.
- Provide feedback to the user about the correctness of the guessed word.
- End the game when the correct word is guessed or when the attempts reach zero.

## Code Quality:

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Implement best practices for React development.
- Ensure error handling for edge cases (invalid input, unexpected behavior).

## Submission Guidelines:

- Fork this [repository](https://github.com/lendstack/lendstack-wordle) and create a new branch for your work.
- Provide clear instructions on how to run the application locally.
- Include a README file explaining your approach, decisions made, and any additional features implemented.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- UI/UX design and functionality.
- Code quality, structure, and maintainability.
- State management and logic implementation.
- Handling of edge cases and error scenarios.
- Bonus points for additional features or optimizations.
