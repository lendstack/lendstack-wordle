# React Wordle Clone

Welcome to the React Wordle Clone, a fun twist on the classic word puzzle game created using React. Test your vocabulary by guessing the hidden word within limited tries!

## Installation

To set up the game locally, follow these simple steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-wordle-clone.git

# Change to the project directory
cd react-wordle-clone

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to enjoy the game!

## How to Play

- You have six attempts to guess a randomly selected 5-letter word.
- Type in your guess and press 'Enter' to submit.
- The color of the letters will change to indicate how close your guess is to the word:
  - **Green**: The letter is in the correct position.
  - **Yellow**: The letter is in the word but not in the right position.
  - **Gray**: The letter is not in the word at all.
- Use these hints to inform your next guess.

## Development

During development, you can make use of the following commands:

- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm test`: Runs the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run eject`: Removes the single build dependency from your project. **Note**: this is a one-way operation and cannot be undone!

## Additional Information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). For more information on React, visit the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

Happy guessing, and have fun sharpening your word skills!
