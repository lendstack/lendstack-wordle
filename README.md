    => Type Your Guess:
        Use your real keyboard to type a word that you think might be the hidden word.
        Remember, the word must be exactly five letters long.

    => Submit Your Guess:
        Once you've typed your five-letter word, press the Enter key on your keyboard to submit your guess.

    => Check Your Result:
        After each guess, the game will give you feedback.
        If your guess is correct, a message box will appear congratulating you on your win!

    => Number of Attempts:
        You have a total of six attempts to guess the correct word.
        Use the feedback from each guess to make better guesses in the next rounds.

    => Winning the Game:
        You win the game by guessing the correct word within the six allowed attempts.

    => Losing the Game:
        If you don't guess the word within six tries, you will receive a message that you've lost the game.
